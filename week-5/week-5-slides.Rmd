# Purpose and Agenda

What's so useful about coding? That question is the focus of this class. We'll focus on _joining_ two data sets in R. We'll again use the NAEP data, joining data on spending on kids to understand whether there are any clear relationships between spending and academic achievement.

## What we'll do in this presentation

- Key Concept: More ggplot2 fun(ctions)
- Reading Recap
- Discussion
- Break
- Key Concept: Joining
- Code-along
- What's next: Assignment(s) and Readings

# Key Concept: More exploratory data analysis (EDA) with ggplot2

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[geom_point()]
**A quick refresher on geom_point()**: 
- Used for creating scatterplots.
- Great for visualizing relationships between two numeric variables.


Example:
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
    geom_point() # consider swapping out with geom_jitter(); what does this do?
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[points colors]
**Changing Points Colors**:
- Colors can provide additional information about data points.
- Use the `color` aesthetic in `aes()` to assign colors based on a variable.

Example:
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt, color = cyl)) +
    geom_point()
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[geom_smooth()]
**geom_smooth()**: 
- Adds a smoothed line to the plot.
- Useful for spotting trends or patterns in scatterplots.
- Can also add a straight regression line with `method = "lm"`.

Example:
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[themes]
**Themes in ggplot2**:
- Themes control the appearance of the plot.
- They dictate elements like background color, gridlines, and font sizes.
- `ggplot2` has several built-in themes, e.g., `theme_minimal()`, `theme_dark()`, and `theme_bw()`
- other packages (e.g., [ggthemes](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/)) add _many_ more themes

Example:
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_minimal()
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[labels]
**Adding Labels**:
- Provide context and clarity to your plots.
- Functions like `labs()`, `xlab()`, `ylab()`, and `ggtitle()` allow for adding or modifying labels.

Example:
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = "MPG vs. Weight",
         x = "Miles per Gallon",
         y = "Weight (1000s lbs)")
```

# Key Concept: More ggplot2 fun(ctions)

* Reading error messages for information
* `ggsave()` for exporting plots
* `scale_color_colorblind()` for colorblind accessibility
* `alpha` for transparency of geoms when there is overplotting

---

# Expanding our knowledge of ggplot2

> I am curious to learn about how I might be able to color subsets of my visualizations. For example, if I have a side-by-side barchart, how could I make 3 out of the 8 bars a different color than the rest (nested variable).

# Discussion

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Background]

- Often, the data we want to analyze are in multiple files (e.g., CSV, or Excel files) or databases (e.g., a SQL database)
- The _key_ to combining data is to ensure that the data we are joining share a common . . . _key_!

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = TRUE}
x
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r, echo = TRUE}
y
```

]

]

.panel[.panel-name[Discussion Question]

- What are some use cases for your research (past or planned) that involve multiple data files? And, why might it be important to join those files together?
- How do you think the integration of diverse data sources can improve the educational experience for students?
-  What challenges or issues do you anticipate when combining data from various sources for fields such as learning analytics?

# Key Concept: Joins

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[two data frames]
**Working with Two Data Frames**: 
- **Data frames**: Tabular structures in R with rows and columns.
- Can be thought of as results from loading two distinct files into R.
- The join functions in `dplyr` work with two data frames.

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = TRUE}
x
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r, echo = TRUE}
y
```

]
]

.panel[.panel-name[visualizing two data frames]

```{r}
#| out.width: 60%
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/original-dfs.png")
```

# Types of dplyr joins: Inner join

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Definition]

> Keep all rows from `x` where there are matching values in `y`, and all columns from `x` and `y`.

```{r}
#| out.width: 60%
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/inner-join.gif")
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[R syntax]

```{r}
#| echo: true
inner_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

]
]

---

# Types of dplyr joins: Left join

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Definition]

> Keep all rows from `x`, and all columns from `x` and `y`. Rows in `x` with no match in `y` will have `NA` values in the new columns.

```{r}
#| out.width: 60%
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/left-join.gif")
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[R syntax]

```{r}
#| echo: true
left_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Extra rows in y]

> ... If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combinations of the matches are returned.

```{r}
#| out.width: 60%
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/left-join-extra.gif")
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[y_extra]

`y_extra` has multiple rows with the key from `x`

```{r}
#| echo: true
y_extra
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[R syntax]

```{r}
#| echo: true
left_join(x, y_extra, by = "key")
```

]

]

---

# Types of dplyr joins: Right join

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Definition]

> Keep all rows from `y`, and all columns from `x` and `y`. Rows in `y` with no match in `x` will have `NA` values in the new columns.

```{r}
#| out.width: 60%
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/right-join.gif")
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[R syntax]

```{r}
#| echo: true
right_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

]
]

---

# Types of dplyr joins: Full join

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Definition]

> Keep all rows and all columns from both `x` and `y`. Where there are not matching values, returns `NA` for the ones missing.

```{r}
#| out.width: 60%
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/full-join.gif")
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[R syntax]

```{r}
#| echo: true
full_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

]
]

---

# Types of dplyr joins: Anti join and semi join

There are also two filtering joins that we won't discuss further at this time: `anti_join()` and `semi_join()`.

---

# Important notes

- If the key columns have different names in each data frame, use the syntax `by = join_by(key1 == key2)` within the join function.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
full_join(a, b, by = join_by(key == id))
```

- If joining by multiple columns, provide them as a vector `by = join_by(key1, key2)`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
full_join(m, n, by = join_by(key, id))
```

- Beware of duplicate rows: Ensure that the key column(s) uniquely identify rows, or you may get unintended repeats.

---

# Code-along

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[left_join()]

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
band_members %>% 
    left_join(band_instruments, by = "name")
# also try right_join!
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[full_join()]

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
band_members %>% 
    full_join(band_instruments,  by = "name")
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[different keys]

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
band_members
band_instruments2

band_members %>% 
    full_join(band_instruments2, by = join_by(name == artist))
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[multiple keys]

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
band_members
# what if the Paul in instruments is from another band?
band_instruments <- 
    band_instruments %>% mutate(band = c("Beatles", "Porcupines", "Stones")) 
# we can then join on both name *and* band
band_members %>% 
    left_join(band_instruments, by = join_by(name, band))
```

]

]

???

May want to demonstrate some of the new ggplot2 code, too (geom_smooth, maybe?)

# What's next?

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Weekly Assignment]

- We'll be joining together two files and conducting an authentic analysis about what relates to student academic achievement
- The analysis will take the form of a scatterplot with a fitted line --- effectively, a visual representation of a simple (one variable) linear regression model

]

.panel[.panel-name[Data]

- We'll be using NAEP data again
- In addition, we'll be using data on state-by-state spending on children; read about the data [here](https://jrosen48.github.io/tidykids/articles/tidykids-codebook.html)
